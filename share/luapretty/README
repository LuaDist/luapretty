* About LuaPretty
  ---------------
  LuaPretty is a syntax aware code highlighter and formatter for the Lua language.
  It can be used separately as a standalone application or as a library from
  within your own Lua project.
  
  Output of LuaPretty consists of reformatted input source code according to a
  given template, which can be later highlighted using custom CSS to produce
  a valid HTML document containing the highlighted and reformatted code.
  
  Formatter templates have the ability to make any change in the given source 
  code. Reformatting the source code is only a small subset of changes that
  can be made inside a formatter user template.

  When using LuaDist for installation, LuaPretty installs to a standalone directory 
  and can be invoked from _luapretty/bin directory. LuaPretty provides two small 
  applications:

  Both scripts can be simply executed using the lua runtime interpreter in the install 
  directory, e.g.:
  	$ cd _luapretty/bin/
  	$ lua lua-formatter.lua
	
  LuaDist also installs binary versions of these sripts.
